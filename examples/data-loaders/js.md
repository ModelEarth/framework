# JavaScript data loaders

The Observable CLI supports [data loaders](../loaders) written in JavaScript. Any library used in JavaScript data loaders must be imported.

## TSV

The data loader below (`oil-spills.tsv.js`) accesses [data about oil spill incidents](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/oil-spill-incident-tracking-ds394) collected by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's [Office of Spill Prevention and Response](https://wildlife.ca.gov/OSPR), does some basic wrangling, then returns a tab-separated value file. 

Copy and paste the code below into your own JavaScript data loader (with extension .tsv.js in your project source root, typically `docs`), then update with your own data and R code to get started.
