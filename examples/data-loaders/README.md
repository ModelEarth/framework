# Data loader examples

The sole purpose of this Observable Framework project is to provide a diverse collection of small, easy to explore, copyable data loaders written in different languages. 

Data loaders are grouped by loader type (e.g. Python, shell script, R, etc.). A variety of data sources and loader payloads (e.g. CSV, JSON, Zip, Parquet, PNG, etc.) are shown throughout.
