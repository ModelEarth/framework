# R data loaders

The Observable CLI has built-in support for R. In an R [data loader](../loaders), you can access, wrangle and analyze data in an R script, then write outputs (like CSV files or ZIP archives) to standard out so they can be attached for use in markdown files. 

To use R data loaders in your project, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and any required R libraries need to be installed.
